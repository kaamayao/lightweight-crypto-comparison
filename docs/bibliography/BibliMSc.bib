  abstract = "With the establishment of the AES the need for new block ciphers
              has been greatly diminished; for almost all block cipher
              applications the AES is an excellent and preferred choice. However,
              despite recent implementation advances, the AES is not suitable for
              extremely constrained environments such as RFID tags and sensor
              networks. In this paper we describe an ultra-lightweight block
              cipher, present. Both security and hardware efficiency have been
              equally important during the design of the cipher and at 1570 GE,
              the hardware requirements for present are competitive with today's
              leading compact stream ciphers.",
